# Cyber Neuron Network: 50 Domains of Cybersecurity (RAG Spiral Structure)

This repository hosts a functional, visually engaging website representing a "Cyber Neuron Network" structure for the 50 key domains of cybersecurity. Each domain card features its core concept, associated knowledge sources, and a dynamic Artificial Neural Network visual theme.

## 🎯 Objective

The site serves as a structured reference and visual exploration of the vast cybersecurity landscape. It connects each domain to relevant learning resources, inspired by concepts and tools shared by cybersecurity professionals, including insights from the LinkedIn profile of [Nandha Kumar M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandha-kumar-m-952342159/).

## 🧠 Structure: RAG Neuron Spiral

*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** The site embodies the idea of retrieving and presenting relevant knowledge sources (links, guides, standards) for each domain.
*   **Neuron:** Each domain is presented as a node/card, visually designed with an Artificial Neural Network aesthetic.
*   **Spiral:** The organization into layers implies a continuous, interconnected learning journey across the domains.

## 🌐 Live Demo

View the site live using GitHub Pages: [https://your-github-username.github.io/cyber-neuron-network/](https://your-github-username.github.io/cyber-neuron-network/) (Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username after publishing).

## 📁 Contents

*   `index.html`: The single HTML file containing the entire website's structure, styling, and content.

## 🔗 Knowledge Sources & Inspiration

The knowledge sources linked within the site are derived from:
*   General cybersecurity resources (e.g., NIST, SANS, OWASP).
*   Insights and shared resources from the LinkedIn profile of [Nandha Kumar M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandha-kumar-m-952342159/), including:
    *   Tools (e.g., APK Tool GUI)
    *   Techniques (e.g., VAPT, Penetration Testing, Threat Intelligence)
    *   Learning Resources (e.g., VAPT & Pentesting Learning Resources post)
    *   Technologies (e.g., AI Agents like AgentKit)
